# DynamicPaging
Pet project to demonstrate paging logic in one <a href="https://github.com/ihorshvh/DynamicPaging/blob/main/index.html">.html</a> file. The list of contacts is located in <a href="https://github.com/ihorshvh/DynamicPaging/blob/main/contacts.json">contacts.json</a> file. The <a href="https://github.com/ihorshvh/DynamicPaging/blob/main/index.html">web page</a> shows 10 contacts per page. Once loaded the js script calculates the number of pages requred to show the whole list and adds page buttons dynamically in to the page. Then, the first page is loaded. The loaded page looks as on the following screen:
